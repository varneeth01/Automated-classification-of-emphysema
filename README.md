# Automated-classification-of-emphysema
This project focuses on the automated classification of emphysema using deep learning models. We employed VGG16 and DenseNet121 architectures to classify emphysema patterns from lung CT scans. To enhance the training process and improve model accuracy, we used data augmentation techniques.
